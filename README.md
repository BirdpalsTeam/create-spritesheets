# create-spritesheets
Code to create spritesheets and add them to a json!
# ATTENTION!
The images' name needs to be in the following format "number + prefix.png", for example
"1blue.png", where blue is the prefix.
In the examples folder there is no prefix, so you just press enter when the code asks you the prefix.
